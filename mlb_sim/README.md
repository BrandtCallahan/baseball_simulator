## MLB Baseball Simulator

Running the play_ball_mlb_daily() function in play_ball.py will return the game results for each MLB matchup on the day. The first result will be the moneyline prediction after 5000 simulations of the game. Second will be the spread result (all MLB games give the game favorite a 1.5 run spread). And third will be the over under result. The result will have both the totals for all three gambling options and the respective percentage on the games simulated.
