The simulator uses on-base percentage (OBP) and walks and hits per innnings pitched (WHIP) to simulate two teams playing against each other. Nowadays OBP can be seen as a promising offensive stat because it follows what was learned through "Moneyball" in that in order to win games you need to score runs and in order to score runs you need to get on base. Just as OBP can be seen as a promising offensive statistic, WHIP can be seen as a promising pitching statistic as it is a statistic that weighs a pitchers performance more reliably and tends to eliminate the skewness a mistakes outside of the pitcher's control throughout the game.
