The simulator uses a batter's on-base percentage (OBP) and a pitcher's out percentage to simulate two teams playing against each other. Nowadays OBP can be seen as a promising offensive stat because it follows what was learned through "Moneyball" in that in order to win games you need to score runs and in order to score runs you need to get on base. Just as OBP can be seen as a promising offensive statistic, a pitcher's ability to get outs (out percentage) helps paint the picture for how efficient a pitcher can throw strikes under the assumption that batter's swing at strikes and getting swings either leads to swings and misses or contact leading to the chance for outs.
